This project is intended to not only provide a visual gui for playing blackjack, it is also intended to give some help for counting cards. Spesifically, this deck uses a ballanced count method, so if you  went through every card in the deck and added their "point" values, you would end up with zero. You can also set the number of decks you play with. The cards 2 through 6 have a +1 point value, and the cards 10 through Ace have a -1 point value. Obviously, in real games you would need to keep track of more than just your hand and the dealer's hand.
